## Virtual Network (VNet)
**Analogy**: A private neighborhood in a city.
- **Description**: Provides a secure, isolated network environment for your Azure resources.

## Subnets
**Analogy**: Different blocks or streets within a neighborhood.
- **Description**: Segments a VNet into smaller, manageable sections.

## Network Security Groups (NSG)
**Analogy**: Security guards at the entrance of each block.
- **Description**: Controls inbound and outbound traffic to network interfaces, VMs, and subnets.

## Application Security Groups (ASG)
**Analogy**: Security badges for specific groups within the neighborhood.
- **Description**: Allows you to configure network security as a natural extension of an applicationâ€™s structure.

## Application Gateway
**Analogy**: A centralized information desk at the mall entrance.
- **Description**: Manages and directs web traffic to specific resources within a VNet.

## App Service
**Analogy**: A fully managed kitchen in the food court.
- **Description**: Allows developers to build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs quickly without managing infrastructure.

## Load Balancer
**Analogy**: A traffic management system in the parking lot.
- **Description**: Distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

## Availability
**Analogy**: Multiple entrances and essential services in the mall.
- **Description**: Ensures that applications remain accessible even if some components fail.

## Scalability
**Analogy**: Ability to add more floors or shops to handle increasing visitors.
- **Description**: Enables applications to handle increased load by scaling up (vertical scaling) or scaling out (horizontal scaling).

## VPN
**Analogy**: A private underground tunnel system connecting the mall to its warehouse.
- **Description**: Provides a secure connection between your on-premises network and your Azure VNet.

## Virtual Machine (VM)
**Analogy**: A versatile pop-up shop in the mall.
- **Description**: Offers flexible, scalable computing resources for various applications.
